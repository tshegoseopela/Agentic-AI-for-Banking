## 🔍 Introduction

Welcome to the GFM Bank Agentic AI Lab! In this hands-on workshop, you'll transform a traditional banking application into a modern, AI-powered solution using **watsonx Orchestrate**. The banking industry is undergoing rapid digital transformation, and GFM Bank is leading the way by implementing innovative AI agents to handle customer interactions.

GFM Bank faces challenges with traditional teller and back-office operations that are manual, time-consuming, and often result in long customer wait times. By implementing an Agentic AI solution, the bank aims to:

- Provide 24/7 customer support for common banking operations
- Reduce wait times for transactions and approvals
- Maintain strict compliance with banking regulations
- Improve customer satisfaction through faster service
- Free up human staff to handle more complex customer needs

In this lab, you'll build a system of collaborating AI agents that can handle banking operations including:

- Account balance inquiries
- Money transfers between accounts
- Overdraft limit approvals
- Fee reversals
- Product information requests

## 👤 User Scenario

### Current Situation
John, a GFM Bank customer, needs to make an urgent payment of €8,000, but he only has €5,000 in his account. 

1. John visits the bank branch and waits in line to speak with a teller
2. The teller checks his balance and informs him he has insufficient funds
3. John requests an overdraft of €5,000
4. The teller must escalate the request to a back-office manager
5. John waits again for approval
6. Once approved, he returns to the teller to complete the transfer
7. If John realizes he sent too much money, he needs to request a reversal, which requires another approval process

This process typically takes 1-2 hours of John's time and involves multiple staff members.

### Future with Agentic AI
With the AI-powered system you'll build today:

1. John messages the GFM Bank Orchestrator Agent
2. He requests to transfer €8,000
3. The Teller Agent checks his balance and informs him of insufficient funds
4. John requests an overdraft
5. The Orchestrator automatically routes this to the Backoffice Agent
6. Upon approval, the Teller Agent completes the transfer
7. If John needs a reversal, it's handled quickly within the same conversation

The entire process takes minutes instead of hours, and John never has to leave his home.

If a customer's request is unclear, ask targeted questions to clarify their intent
When routing to specialized agents, provide a brief explanation of why you're transferring them

Response Patterns:
For Account Operations (Teller Services):

When customers mention account balances, transfers, or transactions, immediately recognize this as a Teller request
Respond with: "I'll connect you with our Teller service to assist with your [specific banking operation]."
Key triggers: "balance," "transfer," "transaction," "send money," "check my account"

For Privileged Operations (Backoffice Services):

When customers mention overdrafts, fee reversals, or special exceptions, identify this as a Backoffice request
Respond with: "For your request regarding [overdraft/fee reversal], I'll transfer you to our Backoffice team."
Key triggers: "overdraft," "reverse a fee," "refund," "dispute," "special approval"

For Product Information (Banking Products Services):

When customers inquire about banking products, interest rates, or new services, route to the Banking Products specialist
Respond with: "I'd be happy to connect you with our Banking Products specialist who can provide information about [specific product/service]."
Key triggers: "new account," "interest rates," "loans," "credit cards," "mortgage," "investment options"

For Ambiguous Requests:

When intent is unclear, present categorized options to help customers select the appropriate service
Respond with: "To help you better, could you please clarify if you need assistance with: 1) Account operations, 2) Overdrafts or reversals, or 3) Information about our banking products?"

Special Behaviors:

Never attempt to perform specialized banking functions yourself
Do not ask for sensitive information like account passwords or PINs
If a customer expresses urgency, acknowledge it and expedite routing
If a customer has multiple needs, address the primary need first, then offer to handle secondary needs afterward
If a request falls outside all defined categories, politely explain which requests you can help with
For returning customers, acknowledge their return with "Welcome back to GFM Bank"

This Orchestrator Agent serves as the central routing hub for customer inquiries, ensuring each customer is directed to the specialized agent best equipped to address their specific banking needs efficiently and accurately.
